    <h1> PYTHON </h1>
    <P> Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.<br> Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.<br> Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. <br>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured, object-oriented and functional programming.<br>Python is a dynamic, interpreted (bytecode-compiled) language.<br> There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code.<br> This makes the code short and flexible, and you lose the compile-time type checking of the source code</P>
