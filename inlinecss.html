        <p>Butterflies are the adult flying stage of certain insects belonging to an order or group called Lepidoptera. <br>Moths also belong to this group.<br> The word "Lepidoptera" means "scaly wings" in Greek. <br>Butterflies are insects that have large, often brightly coloured wings, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. <br>The group comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea and Papilionoidea.<br> The oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though they may have originated earlier.</p>
